What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When you initialize a repository, it creates a .git file that makes the folder a git repository. To do this, you need to type the command 'git init'

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository because you add files to it before you make a commit. It allows you to be able to add only certain files to each commit rather than applying all changes at once.
