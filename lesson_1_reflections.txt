What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	The pros for manually choosing when to create a commit are that you are able to customize when to create commits. You can specifically save them after each change and note what was changed.

	The cons are that you may get caught up in your work and forget to make a commit. It can possibly lead to loss of work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Git allows saving multiple files in one commit because programs rely on other files in order to compile correctly.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	
	Git log will show me the list of all the commits made to a file.

	Git diff will let me see specifically what was changed in two files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	
	Version control will make me more confident to make changes because I can easily go back to any commit and root out the cause and fix it.
